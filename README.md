Update 2018/12/3
(1)Prob 743 Network Delay Time:
    use dijkstra method to find shortest path from k to each node, I`m not sure whether it`s an easy problem.
    
(2)Prob 374 Guess Number Higher or Lower:
    use [left,right) section when using binary search, then left will be the smallest that satisfy the g(middle)

Update 2018/12/5
(1)Prob 111 Minimum Depth of Binary Tree:
    Be careful that the input tree is an extremely unbalanced tree;
(2)Prob 155 Minimum Stack
